## How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I prioritize modularity, functionality, and user experience. I begin by identifying the core features and structuring the program to ensure scalability and maintainability. For this project, I focused on organizing my 3D scene into distinct components, such as objects, lighting, and camera controls, which helped me manage complexity. I also consider how users will interact with the software and strive to create an intuitive and engaging experience.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has enhanced my ability to design 3D environments with a focus on realism. I developed a better understanding of scene composition, lighting placement, and material application, which are crucial for creating immersive visuals.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
Upon selecting a 2D scene for replication, I followed a structured design process that started with planning and wireframing the 3D scene before coding. First, I identified the necessary objects, textures, and lighting elements. Then, I created a basic scene layout, ensuring that each component was positioned correctly. After that, I refined the scene by adjusting textures, materials, and camera controls. This allowed me to make gradual improvements while ensuring a solid foundation.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I used in this project, such as modular design, can be applied to any future software project. Whether working on UI/UX design, software engineering, or game development, breaking down a project into smaller, manageable components ensures efficiency and maintainability. Additionally, focusing on user experience and optimizing performance will always be relevant in any development field.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I approach program development by starting with a clear plan and gradually building functionality in a structured manner. I break down tasks into smaller, reusable functions to maintain clean and organized code. Before implementing features, I ensure that I understand their purpose and how they will interact with other components. Testing is also a key part of my development process, as it allows me to catch errors early and refine the program as needed.
<blockquote>
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I implemented strategies such as modular programming. I ensured that each object was correctly placed and textured before moving on to the next component. I also used reusable functions for common tasks, such as setting up lighting or controlling the camera, which improved code efficiency and readability.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential in refining my 3D scene. I frequently tested and adjusted elements like lighting, textures, and object placement to achieve the desired level of realism and usability. By making small, incremental improvements, I was able to optimize performance and enhance the overall experience without making drastic, time-consuming changes.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
At the start of the project, my focus was primarily on getting the scene to render correctly. As I progressed, I shifted towards optimizing the scene and refining the visual details. Throughout the milestones, I adopted a more structured approach to organizing my code, which ultimately made it easier to maintain and modify.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides me with the problem-solving skills and technical knowledge needed to build innovative software solutions. This project has strengthened my ability to work with computational graphics, which aligns with my long-term goals of software engineering and game development. Understanding how to create and optimize interactive environments will be valuable in these fields.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with computational graphics has improved my understanding of rendering techniques, camera manipulation, and user interaction within virtual environments. These skills will be beneficial in future coursework involving simulations, UI design, and software development. Additionally, visualizing complex data through graphical representations can enhance my problem-solving approach in various subjects.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In a professional setting, the ability to create realistic and interactive 3D environments can be applied to game development, UI/UX design, and software visualization. My experience in computational graphics has given me insight into optimizing performance while maintaining visual context, which is a crucial skill in industries such as technology and entertainment.
